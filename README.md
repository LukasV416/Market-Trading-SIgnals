# Market-Trading-Signals
This project is a Python-based application designed to help identify undervalued or overvalued stocks using a combination of fundamental valuation models and market signals. It collects financial data through APIs, calculates key valuation and risk metrics such as Price-to-Earnings, Debt-to-Equity, Dividend Yield, and more. The project also implements market signal indicators, such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands to flag potential buy or sell opportunities.
